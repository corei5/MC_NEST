16,"Taking the 15 numbers 1, 22, 32, ..., 432 violates the condition. Furthermore, since $S$ does not contain any non-prime numbers with a minimum prime factor of at least 47, there are only 14 types of non-prime numbers in $S$, excluding 1. Applying the Pigeonhole Principle, we conclude that $n=16$.",Alg1,"Let $S=\left\{ 1,2,\cdots 2024 \right\}$, if the set of any $n$ pairwise prime numbers in $S$ has at least one prime number, the minimum value of $n$ is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}."
3906,"Let $n = 4l$.

Then $A_l=\left(5^5l\right)!{C}_{\left(5^5+1\right)n}^n$, where $\nu_5((5^5l)!) = 5^4n + 5^3n + \cdots + n + \nu_5(n!) = \frac{5^5-1}{4}n + \nu_5(n!)$. 

Thus, we need $\nu_{5}\left({C}_{\left(s^{5}+1\right)n}^{n}\right)=\frac{n}{4}-\nu_{5}(n!).$ 

By Kummer's Theorem, this means in base 5, when adding $n$ and $5^5n$, there are $\frac{n}{4} - \nu_{5}(n!)$ carries.

Notice that $\frac{n}{4} - \nu_5(n!) > \frac{n}{4} - \left(\frac{n}{5}+\frac{n}{25}+\cdots\right) = 0$,

which implies there must be carries when adding $n$ and $5^5n$. Thus, $n$ must have at least 6 digits in base 5.

Suppose $n =a_5a_4\cdots a_0$. The number of carries when adding $n$ and $5^5n$ is the same as the number of carries when adding $a_{5}$ and $\overline{a_{5}a_{4}\cdots a_{0}}$. 

Since
\begin{align*}
	\frac{n}{4}-v_5(n!) &= \left(\frac{n}{5}+\frac{n}{25}+\cdots\right)-\left(\left[\frac{n}{5}\right]+\left[\frac{n}{25}\right]+\cdots\right) \\
	&=\left\{\dfrac{n}{5}\right\}+\left\{\dfrac{n}{25}\right\}+\cdots\\
	&=\frac{a_{0}}{5}+\frac{5a_{1}+a_{0}}{25}+\frac{25a_{2}+5a_{1}+a_{0}}{125}+\cdots\\
	&=\frac{a_5+a_4+\cdots+a_0}{4}\\
	&\geqslant\frac{a_{5}+a_{0}}{4}\geqslant\frac{5}{4}>1
\end{align*}


This indicates that in the quintile system $a_5$ and $\overline{a_5a_4\cdots a_0}$ are carried at least 2 times, then $a_{1}=4$. While,
$$
\frac{a_5+a_4+\cdots+a_0}4\geqslant\frac{a_5+a_1+a_0}4\geqslant\frac{9}{4}>2,
$$
which implies $a_{2}=4$. Continuing this process, we find that $a_1=a_2=\cdots=a_5=4$.

And then $\frac{a_5+a_4+\cdots+a_0}4\in\mathbf{Z}$, we get $a_0=4$.

Obviously, such $n$ is indeed satisfied the requirements. Therefore, the minimum value of $l$ that satisfies the condition is $\frac{5^6-1}4=3906$

Finally, note that the number of carries when adding $5n$ to $5^6n$ is the same as the number of carries when adding $5n$ to $5^{5}n$, which means if $l$ satisfies the conditions, then $5l$ also satisfies the conditions, implying that there are infinitely many values of $l$ satisfying the conditions.",Alg2,"Let $A_l = (4l+1)(4l+2) \cdots \left(4(5^5+1)l\right)$.

66,"Let $m$ and $n$ be the number of coins and stickers Sasha originally had, respectively.

According to the problem, we have:
\begin{align}
		mt+n&=100,\label{Alg3_1} \\
       m+nt&=101.\label{Alg3_2}
\end{align}


From \eqref{Alg3_2}$-$\eqref{Alg3_1}, we can learn that

$(n - m)(t - 1) = 1 \Longrightarrow t = 1 + \frac{1}{n - m}$.

From \eqref{Alg3_1}$+$\eqref{Alg3_2}, we can learn that 

$(n + m)(t + 1) = 201 \Longrightarrow t = \frac{201}{m + n} - 1$.

Let $a = n - m$ and $b = n + m$.

Since $n > m$, we have $a > 0$.

Comparing the two different expressions in terms of $t$, we get:

$1 + \frac{1}{n - m} = \frac{201}{m + n} - 1 \Leftrightarrow 1 + \frac{1}{a} = \frac{201}{b} - 1 \Leftrightarrow \frac{2a + 1}{a} = \frac{201}{b}$.

Because $2a+ 1$ and $a$ are coprime, $\frac{2n + 1}{a}$ is in lowest terms, which implies that 201 is divisible by $2a+ 1$. Since $201 = 3 \times 67$, it has only four positive divisors: 1, 3, 67, and 201.

Since $2a + 1 > 1$, there are three possible cases:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $2a + 1 = 3$.
	
	Then $a = 1 \Rightarrow \frac{201}{b} = 3 \Rightarrow b = 67$.
	
	Hence, $m = \frac{1}{2}(b - a) = 33$,
	
	$n = \frac{1}{2}(a + b) = 34$,
	
	and $t = 2$,
	
	which does not satisfy the condition.
	
	
	\item   $2a + 1 = 67$.
	
	Then $a = 33 \Rightarrow \frac{201}{b} = \frac{67}{33} \Rightarrow b = 99$.
	
	Hence, $m = \frac{1}{2}(b - a) = 33$,
	
	$n = \frac{1}{2}(a + b) = 66$,
	
	and $t = \frac{34}{33}$.
	
	It can be easily verified that this case satisfies the condition.
	
	
	\item  $2a + 1 = 201$.
	
	Then $a = 100 \Rightarrow \frac{201}{b} = \frac{201}{100} \Rightarrow b = 100$. 
	
	Hence, $m = \frac{1}{2}(b - a) = 0$,
	
	and $n = \frac{1}{2}(a + b) = 100$. 
	
	Since the number of coins cannot be 0, this case does not satisfy the condition.

101,"For a fan $k$ of 2020, since there exists $x^2+y^2+z^2 \equiv 0 (\mathrm{mod} \, 2020)$, particularly, we have $x^2+y^2+z^2 \equiv 0 (\bmod 4)$. 

Thus, $x^2 \equiv 0$ or $1 (\mathrm{mod} \, 4)$, which implies $x$, $y$, $z$ are all even. 

Therefore, $k \equiv xyz \equiv 0 (\mathrm{mod} \, 4)$.

 Also, $x^2+y^2+z^2 \equiv 0 (\mathrm{mod} \, 5)$, and $x^2 \equiv 0$, $1$, $4 (\mathrm{mod} \, 5)$, so there must be a number among $x$, $y$, $z$ that is a multiple of 5. 
 
 Hence, $k \equiv 0 (\mathrm{mod} \, 5)$. 
 
 Therefore, a fan $k$ of 2020 must be a multiple of 20.

Next, we prove that all multiples of 20 are fans of 2020. 

Since $x^2+y^2+z^2 \equiv 0 (\mathrm{mod} \, 101)$ has solutions, let $x=a$, $y=6a$, $z=8a$, then any $k \equiv xyz \equiv 48a^3 (\mathrm{mod} \, 101)$ is fan of 101.

If there exist $i \neq j$ such that $48i^3 \equiv 48j^3 (\mathrm{mod} \, 101)$ ($0 \leqslant i < j \leqslant 100$), then $(i-j)(i^2+ij+j^2) \equiv 0 (\mathrm{mod} \, 101)$. 

Since $i-j \neq 0 (\mathrm{mod} \, 101)$, we have $i^2+ij+j^2 \equiv 0 (\bmod 101)$. 

Thus, $(2i+j)^2 \equiv -3j^2 (\mathrm{mod} \, 101)$, implying that -3 is a quadratic residue modulo 101.\label{Alg4_1}

But from the law of quadratic reciprocity, $\left( \frac{3}{101} \right) \left( \frac{101}{3} \right) = (-1)^{\frac{3-1}{2} \cdot \frac{101-1}{2}} = 1$, and $\left( \frac{101}{3} \right) = -1$, 

so $\left( \frac{3}{101} \right) = -1$. 

Furthermore, $\left( \frac{-3}{101} \right) = \left( \frac{3}{101} \right) \left( \frac{-1}{101} \right)$. 

Since $100 \equiv 10^2 \equiv -1 (\mathrm{mod} \, 101)$, we have $\left( \frac{-1}{101} \right) = 1$, which implies $\left( \frac{-3}{101} \right) = -1$, contradicting our assumption\ref{Alg4_1}. 

This indicates that when $i$ traverses the complete system modulo 101, $48i^3$ also traverses the complete system modulo 101.

7,"Here we need to use a result from Euler:

$n$ is an even perfect number $\Leftrightarrow$ there exists a prime $p$ such that $2^p - 1$ is prime, and $n = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$.

Now let's use this to solve the problem.

Case 1: $n$ is odd. Then $n-1$ is an even perfect number. We can write $n-1 = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where both $p$ and $2^p - 1$ are primes. In this case,
$$
\frac{n\left(n+1\right)}2=\frac12\left(2^{p-1}\left(2^p-1\right)+1\right)\left(2^{p-1}\left(2^p-1\right)+2\right)=\left(2^{p-1}\left(2^p-1\right)+1\right)\left(2^{p-2}\left(2^p-1\right)+1\right).
$$

When $p=2$, $n=7,\quad\frac{n\left(n+1\right)}{2}=28$, in this case, $n-1$ and $\frac{n\left(n+1\right)}{2}$ are both perfect numbers.

When $p\geq3$,let $N=\frac{n\left(n+1\right)}{2}$, then $N$ is odd, and
$$
\frac{n+1}2=4^{p-1}-2^{p-2}+1=\left(3+1\right)^{p-1}-\left(3-1\right)^{p-2}+1,
$$

We know by the binomial theorem that $\equiv3\times(p-1)-(p-2)\times3+1+1+1\equiv6({\mathrm{mod}}9).$

Thus $3 \mid N$, but $3^2 \nmid N $, can set $N = 3k, 3 \times k $, in this case, $\sigma(N)=\sigma(3)$, $\sigma(k)=4\sigma(k)$, but $2N=2({\mathrm{mod}}4)$, so $\sigma(N)\neq2N$, so $\frac{n(n+1)}2$ is not perfect.

Case 2: $n$ is an even number, if $4\mid n$, then  $n-1=-1({\mathrm{mod}}4)\Rightarrow n-1$ not a perfect square number, at this point for any $d\mid n-1$, we can know that $d$ and $\frac{n-1}d$ one mod $4$ remains -1, and the other ${\mathrm{mod}}4$ remains 1 from  $d\times\frac{n-1}d=n-1\equiv-1({\mathrm{mod}}4)$, leading to $d+\frac{n-1}d\equiv0({\mathrm{mod}}4)$, and $4 \mid \sigma(n-1)$, but $2(n-1)=2({\mathrm{mod}}4)$, so $n-1$ is not perfect.

So, $4 \nmid n$, then, can be set $n=4k+2$, now $N=\frac{n\left(n+1\right)}2=\left(2k+1\right)(4k+3)$ is odd. Because of $\left(2k+1,4k+3\right)=1$, so $\sigma\left(N\right)=\sigma\left(2k+1\right)\sigma\left(4k+3\right).$

Same as above knowable $4 \mid \sigma (4k+3) $, if $\sigma(N)=2N$, we can learn that $4 \mid 2N\Rightarrow 2 \mid N$, this is a contradiction.

To sum up, there is only one $n$ that meets the condition, that is, $n=7.$",Alg12,"If a positive integer's sum of all its positive divisors is twice the number itself, then it is called a perfect number.

264,"Obviously $p<19\:.$

If $p$ is odd, then $p^p+1$ is divisible by 2, so $p^p+1=2$ is prime only if $p=1$.

If $p$ has an odd factor, let $p = mk$, of which $m$ is odd, then

$p^{p}+1=p^{\prime}+1=\left(p^{k}\right)^{m}+1$, at this time, $p^k+1 \mid p^{p}+1\:.$

Thus $p^{\rho+1}$is not a prime number. 

Thus, $p$ can only be an even number less than 19, with only even factors, i.e. $p=2$,$ 4$, $8$, $16$.
If $p=16$, then
$$
16^{18}=2^{64}=\left(2^{10}\right)^6\cdot16>1000^6\cdot16=16\cdot10^{18},

$$
8^8+1=2^{24}+1=\left(2^8\right)^3+1=\left(2^8+1\right)\left(2^{16}-2^8+1\right)\text{is a composite number}.
$$
If $p=4$, then $4^4+1=257$ is prime.

If $p=2$, then $2^2+1=5$ is prime.

So the prime numbers are 2, 5, 257, and their sum is 264.",Alg13,Try to find all prime numbers with the shape $p^p+1$($p$ is a natural number) that have no more than 19 digits and what the sum of these prime numbers is.
2,"Since $m^3 - m = m(m-1)(m+1) \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$, 

we have $q_i = (q_{i-1} - 1)^3 + 3 \equiv (q_{i-1} - 1)^3 \equiv q_{i-1} - 1 \pmod{3}$. 

Therefore, among $q_1$, $q_2$, and $q_3$, at least one must be divisible by 3, and this number should be a power of 3.

However, when $q_0 = 1$, we get $q_1 = 3$, $q_2 = 11$, and $q_3 = 1003 = 17 \times 59$.

$$
Notice the $a_0\equiv a_4\left({\mathrm{mod}}10\right),a_1\equiv a_5\left({\mathrm{mod}}10\right)$, since $\left\{a_n\right\}$ is second order recursive sequence, then $a_{n+4}\equiv\alpha_n({\mathrm{mod}}10)\:.$

Thus $a_{1000}\equiv a_{996}\equiv a_{992}\equiv\cdots\equiv a_0\equiv2({\mathrm{mod}}10).$

Since $9 \mid 1332$, it follows that $9 \mid N = \overline{a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5}$, and consequently $9\mid (a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+a_{4}+a_{5})$.

Thus, $N$ must be a multiple of $1332 \cdot 9 = 11988$.

The digit in the tens place of $n^3$ is determined by $120k$.

Since we require the tens digit of $n^{3}$ to be 8, the units digit of $12k$ should be 8, meaning the units digit of $k$ must be 4 or 9. Therefore, we can let $k=5m+4$($m$ is a non-negative integer).

Then $n^3=\left\lceil10(5m+4)+2\right\rceil^3=125000m^3+315000m^3+264600m+74088$.


To make the hundreds digit of $n^{3}$ 8, we need the units digit of $2646m$ to be 8. The smallest value of $m$ that satisfies this condition is 3.

Then, $k=5m+4=19$, and $n=10k+2=192$.

It can be verified that $n^3=7077888$, and its last three digits are 888.

 Therefore, the minimum value of $n$ is 192.",Alg17,"If the last three digits of a positive integer $n$ cubed are 888, then the minimum value of $n$ is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}."
81,"Let $100a+b=m^2$, $201a+b=n^2$, then

$101a=n^2-m^2=\left(n-m\right)\left(n+m\right),\:m,\:n<100.$

So, $n - m < 100, n + m <200 $, $101\mid \left(m+ n\right).$

Thus, $m+n=101\:.$

By substituting $a=n-m=2n-101$, we obtain

Thus, $a = n-m = 17$, $b = n^2-402n+20301= 64$, i.e.$(a, b) =(17,64)$ .

34,"First, prove that for all $n{\geq}17$, there are more than 2 different expressions.

Since every positive integer can be expressed as the sum of the squares of four or less positive integers (Lagrange's four-squares theorem),

there exsit non-negative integer $x_i , y_i, z_i, w_i \left(i = 1, 2, 3, 4 \right) $ that satisfy
$$n-0^2=x_0^2+y_0^2+z_0^2+w_6^2,$$

$$n-4^2=x_4^2+y_4^2+z_4^2+w_4^2,$$
It follows that
\begin{align*}
	n &=x_0^2+y_0^2+z_0^2+w_0^2=1^2+x_1^2+y_1^2+z_1^2+w_1^2=2^2+x_2^2+y_2^2+z_2^2+w_2^2\\
	&=3^2+x_3^2+y_3^2+z_3^2+w_3^2=4^2+x_4^2+y_4^2+z_4^2+u_4^2.
\end{align*}


Suppose $n\neq1^2+2^2+3^2+4^2=30$. Then,
\[
\left\{1,2,3,4\right\}\neq\left\{x_0,y_0,z_0,w_0\right\}.
\]

Therefore, there exists $k\in\{1,2,3,4\}\setminus\{x_0,y_0,z_0,u_0\}$, and for such $k$,
$
x_0^2+y_0^2+z_6^2+u_0^2\text{ and }k^2+x_k^2+y_k^2+z_2^2+u_k^2\text{ are distinct}.
$

Because $30=1^2+2^2+3^2+4^2=1^2+2^2+5^2$, it suffices to consider $1\leq n\leq16$. 

The following positive integers have two or more different expressions:
\begin{align*}
	&4=2^2=1^2+1^2+1^2+1^2 \\
	&5=1^2+2^2=1^2+1^2+1^2+1^2+1^2 \\

1989,"Since $44x \geq 86868$, we have $x \geq \left[  \frac{86868+43}{44}\right] = 1975$. 

Thus, $x$ is at least a four-digit number.

On the other hand, if $x$ has $k \geq 5$ digits, then
$ 44x - 86868 > 4 \times 10^k - 10^5 \geq 3 \times 10^k > 9^k,$

which implies $44x - 86868 > p(x)$, where $p(x)$ is the product of the $k$ digits of $x$. This is a contradiction, so $x$ is exactly a four-digit number.

Given that the sum of the digits $S(x)$ satisfies $1 \leq S(x) \leq 36$, we have $S(x) = 1, 8$, or $27$. Obviously, $S(x) = 1$ is not valid.

Since $0 < p(x) \leq 9^4 = 6561$, we have $x \leq \left[\frac{86868+6561}{44} \right]= 2123$.

The only possibilities for $x$ satisfying $1975 \leq x \leq 2123$, $S(x) = 8$ or $27$, and $p(x) \neq 0$ are $1989$, $1998$, $2114$, and $2123$. After checking, we find that only $x=1989$ satisfies the given condition, where the product of its digits equals $44x - 86868$. Therefore, $x=1989$ is the unique solution to this problem.

Hence, the sum of all such natural numbers $x$ is $1989$.",Alg20,"Given that the product of the digits of a natural number $x$ is equal to $44x-86868$, and the sum of its digits is a perfect cube. Then the sum of all such natural numbers $x$ is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}."
"251,7","Since \(9(2a+b)^2=3^2(2a+b)^2\) is a perfect square, it follows that \(509(4a+511b)\) must also be a perfect square. Since \(509\) is a prime number, we can express \(4a+511b\) as {\(509 \times 3^2k^2\)}\label{Alg21_1} .

Hence, the original equation becomes \(9(2a+b)^2=509^2 \times 3^2k^2\), which simplifies to \(2a+b=509k\).

Substituting \(b=509k-2a\) into the equation \ref{Alg21_1}, we get \(4a+511(509k-2a)=509\times 3^2k^2\). Solving this equation yields \(a=\frac{k(511-9k)}{2}\).

Since \(a\) is prime, \(\frac{k(511-9k)}{2}\) must also be prime. Thus, we consider the following cases:

(1) When \(k=1\), \(a=\frac{k(511-9k)}{2}=\frac{511-9}{2}=251\) is prime, and \(b=509k-2a=509-2a=7\).

(2) When \(k=2\), \(a=\frac{k(511-9k)}{2}=\frac{511-18}{2}=493=17\times29\), which is not prime.

(3) When \(k>2\) and \(k\) is odd, \(a=\frac{k(511-9k)}{2}=k\cdot\frac{511-9k}{2}\) is prime. Since \(k>1\), \(\frac{511-9k}{2}=1\), but this equation has no integer solutions.

(4) When \(k>2\) and \(k\) is even, \(a=\frac{k(511-9k)}{2}=\frac{k}{2}(511-9k)\) is prime. Since \(\frac{k}{2}>1\), \(511-9k=1\), but this equation has no integer solutions.

Thus, we conclude that \(a=251\) and \(b=7\).",Alg21,"Given \(a\) is a prime number and \(b\) is a positive integer such that \(9(2a+b)^2=509(4a+511b)\), we need to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\)."
14,"(1) Proof: When $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes, $\varphi(pq)=(p-1)(q-1)$.

 Since $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes, the natural numbers less than $pq$ and coprime to $pq$ cannot be divisible by $p$ or $q$.

Out of the $pq-1$ natural numbers from $1$ to $pq-1$, $q-1$ numbers are divisible by $p$ and $p-1$ numbers are divisible by $q$. Thus,
$$
\varphi(pq)=pq-1-(p-1)-(q-1)=(p-1)(q-1).
$$
(2) From (1), we have $(p-1)(q-1)=3p+q$, which simplifies to $pq-4p-2q+1=0$, or $(p-2)(q-4)=7$.

 p-2=1, \\q-4=7,

$$
\begin{cases}
	p-2=-7, \\q-4=-1.

Solving these equations, we get $p=3$, $q=11$.

Hence, the sum of $p$ and $q$ is $14$.",Alg22,"Let $\varphi(n)$ denote the number of natural numbers coprime to and less than $n$. Then, when $\varphi(pq)=3p+q$, what is the sum of $p$ and $q$?"
840,"Let $\varphi(n)$ denote the Euler's totient function, which counts the number of positive integers less than $n$ that are coprime to $n$.

It's easy to observe that in $S_n$, every pair of adjacent numbers are coprime, and the larger number equals the sum of its two adjacent neighbors.

Now, we use mathematical induction to prove that for $n\geq2$, each pair of coprime numbers $a$ and $b$ less than or equal to $n$ appears adjacent exactly twice in $S_2, S_3, \cdots, S_n$.

By symmetry, it suffices to show that $a$ and $b$ appear adjacent exactly once to the left of $n$. The case $n=2$ is obvious.

Assume the result holds for $n-1$ ($n-1\geq2$). Consider only the left of $2$.

If $a<n$, then $a$ and $b$ are not adjacent in $S_n$.

Otherwise, if $a$ and $b$ are adjacent in $S_n$, then $\alpha-b$ and $b$ are both in $S_{n-1}$ and adjacent. By the inductive hypothesis, $\alpha$ and $b$ are adjacent in $S_2, S_3, \cdots, S_{n-1}$. Thus, $\alpha-b$ and $b$ are adjacent in $S_2, S_3, \cdots, S_{n-2}$. This implies that $a-b$ and $b$ are adjacent in $S_2, S_3, \cdots, S_{n-1}$ at least twice, a contradiction.

Therefore, $a$ and $b$ appear adjacent exactly once to the left of $n$. By symmetry, they appear adjacent exactly once to the right of $n$ as well. Hence, $a$ and $b$ appear adjacent exactly twice in $S_2, S_3, \cdots, S_n$.

Now, consider those first occurrences of $n$ in $S_2, S_3, \cdots, S_n$ (not limited to the left of $2$). These are the numbers in $S_n$ coprime to $n$, less than $n$, and their sum equals $n$. By the above argument, there are exactly $2\varphi(n)$ numbers adjacent to $n$. Thus, the number of occurrences of $n$ in $S_n$ is $\varphi(n)$.

Hence, in $S_{1938}$, the number of occurrences of $1988$ is $\varphi(1988)=\varphi(4)\varphi(7)\varphi(71)=840$.",Alg23,"Consider the sequence $\{S_n\}$ constructed as follows: $S_1=\{1,1\}$, $S_2=\{1,2,1\}$, $S_3=\{1,3,2,3,1\}$, and in general, if $S_k=\{a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n\}$, then $S_{k+1}=\{a_1,a_1+a_2,a_2,a_2+a_3,\cdots,a_{n-1}+a_n,a_n\}$.

Define $i=a_1+b_1+c_1$, $j=a_2+b_2+c_2$, and $k=a_3+b_3+c_3$. Given the conditions of the problem, we have $i+10j+100k=2005$, and $i$, $j$, $k$ are each less than or equal to $27$.

$(i,j,k)=(5,0,20),(5,10,19),(5,20,18),(15,9,19),\\
(15,19,18),(25,8,19),(25,18,18)$.

Thus, when $(i,j,k)=(25,18,18)$, $S(a)+S(b)+S(c)=i+j+k$ is maximized.

For $i=25$, the possible pairs $(a_1,b_1,c_1)$ are $(7,9,9)$, $(8,8,9)$, and their permutations, giving $3\times2=6$ possible pairs.

It seems $K(n,m)$ only depends on $n$, not on $m$.

Now, let's prove two lemmas using mathematical induction.

\textbf{Lemma 1:} $K(2n,m)=\{2j|j\in K(n,m)\}$.

\textbf{Proof:} Assume the proposition holds for positive integers less than $n$. 

For $i=1$, it's clear that $1\in K(2n-1,m)$ and $1\notin K(2n,m)$, then $n\in\mathbb{N}_+$ implies $2j+1\notin K(2n,m)$. 

Also, $2j\in K(2n,m) \Longleftrightarrow K(2j,m)\cap K(2n-2j,m)=\varnothing$ 

$\Longleftrightarrow  K(j,m)\cap K(n-j,m)=\varnothing$ (by induction hypothesis)

$\Longleftrightarrow j\in K(n,m)$.

\textbf{Lemma 2:} $K(2^n+i,m)=\{2^n+i\}\cup K(i,m)\cup\{2^n+i-j|j\in K(i,m)\}$, where $1\leq i<2^n$.

\textbf{Proof:} Assume the proposition holds for positive integers less than $2^n+i$. 

For any $j\in K(i,m)$, if $j<i$, then 

$K(j,m)\cap K(i-j,m)=\varnothing$

$\Rightarrow K(j,m)\cap K(2^n-i,m)=\varnothing$ (by induction hypothesis)

$\Rightarrow j\in K(2^n+i,m)$. 

If $j=i$, then $i\in K(i,m)$ and $K(j,m)\cap\{2^n\}=\varnothing$, so

 $K(i,m)\cap K(2^n,m)=\varnothing$ and thus $i\in K(2^n+i,m)$.
 
  So, $K(i,m)\subset K(2^n+i,m)$. 
  
  For any $j\in K(2^n+i,m)$, if $j<\frac{2^n+i}{2}$, then 
  
  $K(j,m)\cap K(2^n+i-j,m)=\varnothing$
  
  $\Rightarrow j\in K(i,m)$ (by induction hypothesis). 
  
  
  If $j=i+k$ and $k<2^{n-1}$, then we need to prove 
  $K(i+k,m)\cap K(2^n-k,m)\neq\varnothing$. 
  
  In binary representation, if $j<\frac{2^n+i}{2}$ and there is no carry when adding $i$ and $k$, then $2^a\in K(i+k,m)\cap K(2^n-k,m)$; 
  
  otherwise, if there is a carry at position $t<n$, then $2^t\in K(i+k,m)\cap K(2^n-k,m)$. This concludes the proof of Lemma 2.

Now, let's answer the original question. From Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, we have:
\begin{align*}
	|K(2004,m)| &= |K(1002,m)| = |K(501,m)| = |K(256+245,m)| \\
	&= 2|K(245,m)|+1 = 2|K(128+117,m)|+1 \\
	&= 4|K(117,m)|+3 = 4|K(64+53,m)|+3 \\
	&= 8|K(53,m)|+7 = 8|K(32+21,m)|+7 \\
	&= 16|K(21,m)|+15 = 16|K(16+5,m)|+15 \\
	&= 32|K(5,m)|+31 = 32\times3+31 = 127.

10,"If $x=y$, then there are obviously no solutions to the equation.

From the given equation, we have $x^y\equiv-19({\mathrm{mod}}y)$. Since $x$ and $y$ are both coefficients and $x\neq y$, then $(x,y)=1$. By Fermat's Little Theorem, we have $x^{y-1}\equiv1({\mathrm{mod}}y)$. Thus, we have $x+19\equiv0\left({\mathrm{mod}}y\right)$.

Similarly, $19-y\equiv0\left({\mathrm{mod}}x\right)$. As $x-y+19\equiv0\left({\mathrm{mod}}y\right)$ and $x-y+19\equiv0\left({\mathrm{mod}}x\right)$, we get $x-y+19\equiv0({\mathrm{mod}}xy)$.

It is evident that $x-y+19\neq0$, thus $x+y+19>|x-y+19|\geq xy$, implying $(x-1)(y-1)<20$. Therefore, $|x-y|<19$ and $x-y+19\geq xy$, i.e., $(x+1)(y-1)\leq18$.

So, when $x\geq5$, we have either $y=2$ or $y=3$. However, $x^2-2^x<0$, $x^3-3^x<0$, and $xy^2-19>0$, leading to contradictions. Hence, $x\leq4$.

Additional solutions must satisfy $\left(ab+1\right)^2-4\left(a+b\right)^2=0$.

76,"\\
\textbf{Approach 1}: Since $5 - 5(p+1) + (77p - 1) + 1 = 66p$, $x=1$ is a natural number solution of the original cubic equation. 

By synthetic division, the cubic equation is reduced to the quadratic equation $5x^2 - 5px + 66p - 1=0$(1). 

This problem is transformed into finding all real numbers $p$ such that the equation (1) has two natural number solutions. 

Let $u$ and $v(u\leq v)$ be the two natural number solutions of equation (1). By Vieta's formulas, we have:
$$
\begin{cases}
	v+u=p,(2)\\
	vu=\frac{1}{5}(66p-1).(3)
\end{cases}
$$
From (2) and (3), we eliminate $p$ to get $5uv=66(u+v)-1\:.$(4)

From the condition, neither $u$ nor $v$ can be divisible by 2, 3, or 11. So, $u\geq 14$.

Furthermore:
Since 49, $\nu=\frac{66u-1}{5u-66}$.(5)
$u>66/5$ and $u\geq 14$ imply $u\geq 17$.

Since 2, 3, and 11 do not divide $u$, $u\geq 17$.

Also from $\mathcal{v}{\geq}u$, we get $\frac{\text{66}u-1}{5u-66}\geq u$.

 Thus, $5u^2-132u+1{\leq}0$, and $u\leq\frac{66+\sqrt{66^2-5}}5<\frac{132}5$.
 
Since 2, 3, and 11 do not divide $u$, $u$ can only be 17, 19, 23, or 25.

By solving (5) when $u=17, 19, 23, 25$, we find that when $u=17$, $\nu=59$, and both are natural numbers.

\textbf{Approach 2}: From equation (5) in Approach 1, we get
 $v=\frac{66u-1}{5u-66}=13+\frac{u+857}{5u-66}=13+\frac15\left(1+\frac{4351}{5u-66}\right)=13+\frac15\left(1+\frac{19\times229}{5u-66}\right)$. 
 
 To ensure $v$ is an integer, $5u-66$ must divide 19 or 229. 
 
 By considering the prime factors of 19 and 229, we find that $5u-66=19$ when $u=17$, and $5u-66=229$ when $u=59$. Since $5u-66=229$ leads to $v\notin\mathbb{N}$, we discard it.
 
  Therefore, $p=u+v=76$.

\textbf{Approach 3}: From Approach 1, for equation (1) to have natural numbers as solutions, $\Delta=25p^2-4\times5(66p-1)$ must be a perfect square. 

Assuming $25p^2-20(66p-1)=q^2$, we get $(5p-132)^2-17404=q^2$. Let $5p-132=m$, then $m^2-q^2=17404$. 

This implies both $m$ and $q$ are even. Setting $m=2m_0$ and $q=2q_0$, we get $m_0^2-q_0^2=4351=19\times229$. Solving the system of equations derived from $m>q$, we find $m_0=\pm2176,\pm124$. 

Thus, $5p-132=2m_{0}=\pm4352$ or $248$. From equation (5) in Approach 1, $p$ is a natural number. From (3), we conclude that both $u$ and $v$ are odd. 

Since (2) implies $p$ is even, we find $p=76$.",Alg32,"Let $p$ be a real number. If all three roots of the cubic equation $5x^3 - 5(p+1)x^2 + (71p - 1)x + 1 = 66p$ are natural numbers, then the sum of all possible values of $p$ is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}."
7,"Since any odd perfect square leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, and any even perfect square is a multiple of 4, it follows that among three squares, there must be two even squares and one odd square.

Let $a = 2m, b = 2n, c = 2k - 1$, where $m, n, k$ are positive integers. The original equation becomes:
\[ m^2 + n^2 + k(k - 1) = 501 (1)\]
Since the remainder when a square is divided by 3 can only be 0 or 1, two cases need to be considered.

(i) If $3 | k(k - 1)$, then both $m$ and $n$ must be multiples of 3. Let $m = 3m_1, n = 3n_1$, and $\frac{k(k - 1)}{3}$ be an integer. This yields:

\[ 3m^2 + 3n^2 + \frac{k(k - 1)}{3} = 167  (2) \]

Solving for $\frac{k(k - 1)}{3} \equiv 167 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$ gives $\frac{k(k - 1)}{3} = 3r + 2$, and $k(k - 1) = 9r + 6$. (3)Since $k \leq 22$, we can try $k = 3, 7, 12, 16, 21$, which lead to:

\[ \begin{cases} k = 3, \\ m_1^2 + n_1^2 = 55 \end{cases} \]

\[ \begin{cases} k = 7, \\ m_1^2 + n_1^2 = 51  \end{cases} \]
\[ \begin{cases}k = 12, \\ m_1^2 + n_1^2 = 41\end{cases} \]
\[ \begin{cases} k = 16, \\ m_1^2 + n_1^2 = 29 \end{cases} \]
 \[ \begin{cases} k = 21,\\ m_1^2 + n_1^2 = 9 \end{cases} \]

Among these, only $k = 12$ and $k = 16$ have positive integer solutions.

For $k = 12$, we get $(m_1, n_1) = (4, 5)$, resulting in $a = 6m_1 = 24, b = 6n_1 = 30, c = 2k - 1 = 23$.

For $k = 16$, we get $(m_1, n_1) = (2, 5)$, resulting in $a = 6m_1 = 12, b = 6n_1 = 30, c = 2k - 1 = 31$.

(ii) If $3 \nmid k(k - 1)$, then either $k$ or $k - 1$ must be divisible by 3. Hence, $k$ is congruent to 2 modulo 3, and $k$ can only be 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, or 20.

For each of these values, we need to check if $\frac{k(k - 1)}{3}$ yields an integer:

For $k = 2$, $m_1^2 + n_1^2 = 499$, which does not have a solution.

For $k = 5$, $m_1^2 + n^2 = 481$, which has solutions $(m, n) = (9, 20)$ or $(15, 16)$.

 For $k = 8$, $m_1^2 + n_1^2 = 391$, which does not have a solution.

For $k = 11$, $m^2 + n^2 = 319$, which does not have a solution.

 For $k = 14$, $m_1^2 + n_1^2 = 229$, which does not have a solution.

 For $k = 17$, $m_1^2 + n_1^2 = 121 = 11^2$, resulting in $(m, n) = (2, 15)$.

For $k = 20$, $m^2 + n_1^2 = 121 = 11^2$, which does not have a solution.

Therefore, there are 7 solutions:

$(23, 24, 30), (12, 30, 31), (9, 18, 40), (9, 30, 32), (4, 15, 42), (15, 22, 36), (4, 30, 33)$. All of these satisfy the original equation.",Alg33,"The number of triples of positive integers $(a, b, c)$ satisfying $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2005$ and $a \leq b \leq c$ is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}."
1991,"First, let's prove by mathematical induction:

For any odd number $a \geq 3$, for all positive integers $n$, we have $\left(1 + a\right)^{a^\alpha} = 1 + S_n a^{n+1}$, where $S_n$ is an integer and $a \nmid S_n$.

For $n = 1$, we have $\left(1 + a\right)^a = 1 + C_{\mu}^{1}a + C_{\mu}^{2}a^{2} + \cdots + C_{\mu}^{\mu}a^{a} = 1 + a^{2}\left(1 + C_{\mu}^{2} + C_{\mu}^{3}a + \cdots + a^{a-2}\right)$. Since $a$ is odd, $a | C_a^2$, thus $a | C_a^2 + C_a^3\alpha + \cdots + \alpha^{\alpha-2}$, and therefore $a \nmid S_1 = 1 + C_a^2 + \cdots + a^{a-2}$. Hence, equation(1) holds for $n = 1$.

Assume that equation(1) holds for a natural number $n = k_0$. Then

\[ \left(1 + a\right)^{a_0 + 1} = \left[\left(1 + a\right)^{k_0}\right]^a = \left(1 + S_{k_0}a^{k_0+1}\right)^a \]
\[ = 1 + S_{k_{0}}a^{k_{0}+2} + C_{u}^{2}S_{k_{0}}^{2}a^{2k_{0}+2} + \cdots + S_{k_{0}}a^{a(k_{0}+1)} = 1 + S_{k_{0}+1}a^{k_{0}+2}, \]

where $S_{k_0+1} = S_{k_0} + C_{a}^{2}S_{k_0}^{2}a^{k_0} + \cdots + S_{k_0}^{i}a^{a(k_0+1)-k_0-2}$. By the induction hypothesis, $a \nmid S_k$, hence $a \nmid S_{k_0+1}$. Therefore, equation(1) holds for $n = k_0 + 1$.

Hence, equation(1) holds for all natural numbers $n$. Similarly, we can prove:

For any odd number $b \geq 3$, for all positive integers $n$, we have $\left(b-1\right)^{b^n} = -1 + T_n b^{n+1}$, where $T_n$ is an integer and $b \nmid T_n$.

Using(1)and (2), we can find integers $S$ and $T$ such that $1991^\nmid S$, $1991 \nmid T$, and
\[ 1990^{1991^{1992}} + 1992^{1991^{1990}} = T \cdot 1991^{1993} + S \cdot 1991^{1991} = 1991^{1991} \left(T \cdot 1991^2 + S\right). \]

Thus, the maximum $k$ we seek is $1991$.",Alg34,The maximum positive integer $k$ that satisfies $1991^k \mid 1990^{19911992} + 1992^{19911990}$ is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}.

\[ 79 \mid (a + 77b) \Leftrightarrow 79 \mid (a - 2b) \Leftrightarrow 79 \mid (39a - 78b) \Leftrightarrow 79 \mid (39a + b), \]

\[ 77 \mid (a + 79b) \Leftrightarrow 77 \mid (a + 2b) \Leftrightarrow 77 \mid (39a + 78b) \Leftrightarrow 77 \mid (39a + b), \]

so $79 \times 77 \mid (39a + b)$. Thus, $39a + b = 79 \times 77k$, where $k \in \mathbb{N}_+$.

Note that
\[ 39a + 39b = 79 \times 77k + 38b = (78^2 - 1)k + 38b = (78^2 - 39)k + 38(k + b). \]

So, $39 \mid (b + k)$, and we have $b + k \geq 39$. Therefore, $39\alpha + 39b \geq (78^2 - 39) + 38 \times 39$, which implies $a + b \geq 156 - 1 + 38 = 193$.

It is easy to see that $b = 38$ and $\alpha = 155$ satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, $a + b = 193$.

Hence, the minimum value of $(s + n)_{\min}$ = 193.",Alg35,Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers such that $79 \mid (a + 77b)$ and $77 \mid (a + 79b)$. Then the smallest possible value of the sum $a + b$ is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}.

Proof by contradiction: Suppose $n = 4$. Let $x^2 + x + 4 = \sum_{i=1}^4 (a_ix + b_i)^2$, where $a_i, b_i \in \mathbb{Q}$. Then,

\[ \sum_{i=1}^4 a_i^2 = 1, \quad \sum_{i=1}^4 a_ib_i = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{i=1}^4 b_i^2 = 4. \]
So,
\[ \frac{15}{4}= \left(-\alpha_1b_2 + \alpha_2b_1 - \alpha_3b_4 + \alpha_4b_3\right)^2 + \left(-\alpha_1b_4 + \alpha_3b_1 - \alpha_1b_2 + \alpha_2b_1\right)^2 + \left(-\alpha_1b_4 + \alpha_4b_1 - \alpha_2b_3 + \alpha_3b_2\right)^2. \]

Without loss of generality, assume that at least one of $a, b, c, d$ is odd and $a^2, b^2, c^2, d^2 \equiv 0, 1, 4 \pmod{8}$.

Furthermore, for any positive integer $n$, we have $b | \alpha_n - 2n\alpha^n$, $b | \alpha_{n+1} - 2(n+1)\alpha^{n+1}$, and $b | \alpha_{n+2} - 2(n+2)\alpha^{n+2}$. Combining these with $\alpha_{n+2} = \alpha_{n+1} + \alpha_n$ and $b = 2\alpha - 1$ being odd, we get
	\[ b | (n+2)a^{n+2} - (n+1)a^{n+1} - na^n. \]
	Since $(b, a) = 1$, we have $b | (n+2)a^2 - (n+1)a - n$.
	\item By setting $n$ to $n+1$ in the above equation, we get $b | (n+3)a^2 - (n+2)a - (n+1)$. Subtracting this from the previous equation yields $b | a^2 - a - 1$, i.e., $2a - 1 | a^2 - a - 1$. So, $2a - 1 | 2a^2 - 2a - 2$. Since $2\alpha^2 \equiv \alpha \pmod{2\alpha - 1}$, we have $2\alpha - 1 | -\alpha - 2$ and $2\alpha - 1 | -2\alpha - 4$. Thus, $2\alpha - 1 | -5$, implying $2\alpha - 1 = 1$ or $5$. However, $2\alpha - 1 = 1$ leads to $b = \alpha$, which is a contradiction. Hence, $2\alpha - 1 = 5$, giving $\alpha = 3$ and $b = 5$.
	\item Now, we need to show that when $a = 3$ and $b = 5$, for any positive integer $n$, we have $5 | (\alpha_n - 2n\alpha^n)$. For $n = 1, 2$, we have $\alpha_1 = 1$ and $\alpha_2 = \alpha + \beta = 1$, so $\alpha_1 - 2 \times 3 = -5$ and $\alpha_2 - 2 \times 2 \times 3^2 = -35$, which confirms the condition. Assuming the condition holds for $n = k, k+1$, we can prove it for $n = k+2$ as well. Hence, $\left(a, b\right) = \left(3, 5\right)$ satisfies the conditions.

\[ 1+C_n^1+C_n^2+C_n^3 = 1+n+\frac{n(n-1)}{2}+\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} = \frac{(n+1)(n^2-n+6)}{6}, \]

\[ m(m^2-3m+8) = 3 \times 2^{k+1}. \]
Now, let's consider different cases for $m$.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If $m = 2^s$ where $m > 4$ and $s \geq 3$, then $m^{2}-3m+8 = 3 \times 2^{t}$ for some $t \in \mathbb{N}$. If $s \geq 4$, then $m^{2}-3m+8 = 3 \times 2^{t} \equiv 8 \pmod{16}$. So, $t = 3$, which implies $m^{2}-3m+8 = 24$, i.e., $m(m-3) = 16$, which is not possible. Thus, we have only $s = 3$, which gives $m = 8$, i.e., $n = 7$.
	\item If $m = 3 \times 2^{u}$ where $m > 4$ and $u \geq 1$, then $m^{2}-3m+8 = 2^{\nu}$ for some $\nu \in \mathbb{N}$. If $u \geq 4$, then $m^{2}-3m+8 = 2^{\nu} \equiv 8 \pmod{16}$. So, $\nu = 3$, which implies $m(m-3) = 0$, which is not possible. Also, for $u = 1$ and $u = 2$, $m^{2}-3m+8$ cannot be a power of $2$. When $m = 3 \times 2^3 = 24$, we find $n = 23$.

Thus, the solutions are $n = 7$ and $n = 23$. Therefore, the sum is $7 + 23 = 30$.",Alg38,"Let $n$ be a natural number greater than $3$ such that $1+C_n^1+C_n^2+C_n^3$ divides $2^{2000}$. Then, the sum of all such $n$ satisfying this condition is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}."
160,"Let $k$ be a decimal number, and let $s$ be the product of the digits of $k$.

It's easy to see that $s \in \mathbb{N}$, so $8$ divides $k$ and $\frac{25}{8}k-211 \geq 0$, implying $k \geq \frac{1688}{25}$. Since $k \in \mathbb{N}_+$, we have $k \geq 68$.

Also, since $8$ divides $k$, the units digit of $k$ must be even, making $s$ even as well. Since $211$ is odd, $\frac{25}{8}k$ is odd, implying $16$ divides $k$. Let $k=\overline{a_1a_2\cdots a_i}$, where $0 \leq a_i \leq 9$ for $i=2,3,\cdots,t$ and $1 \leq a_1 \leq 9$. By definition, we have:

\[ S = \prod_{i=1}^t a_i \leq a_1 \times 9^{-i} < a_1 \times 10^{-1} = \overline{a_1}\underbrace{00\cdots0}_{t-1 \text{ digits}} \leq k \:. \]

Therefore, $k > s = \frac{25}{8}k-211$, implying $k \leq 99$.

Since $8$ divides $k$ and $16$ does not divide $k$, we have $k = 72$ or $88$. Upon verification, both $k = 72$ and $k = 88$ satisfy the given condition. Hence, the answer is $72+88=160$.",Alg39,"In the decimal representation, the product of the digits of $k$ equals $\frac{25}{8}k-211$.

Furthermore, $n^{2}+4n-2005=10\:p(n)\leq10n$ implies $n\leq47$. 
Hence, we deduce that $n\in\{43,44,45,46,47\}$.

Consider the following two cases.

$(1)$ When $x-y=0$. Let $x=y=m$ be substituted into the system of equations, resulting in $\alpha=m^{2}-m=m\left(m-1\right)$.

Moreover, $45\times44=1980<2005$ and $46\times45=2070>2005$. Since $m$ can take all integers from $1$ to $45$, there are $45$ values of $\alpha$ satisfying this condition.

154,"Clearly, $1\in B$ (if not, $1\in A$, and by condition (3), for any $b\in B$, $1\times b=b\in A$, contradiction).

Since $13\in A$, we have $13+1=14\in B$ (if not, $7\in B$, implying $14\in A$, contradiction). Also, $2\times13+1=27\in B$, leading to $9\in B$. Similarly, $3\times13+1=40\in B$, hence $20,10,5\in B$, and $8\in B$ (if not, $8\in A$, implying $8\times5=40\in A$, contradiction). Moreover, $5\times13+1=66\in B$, yielding $33,22,11\in B$.

3,"It is easy to verify that $S = \{-1,0,1\}$ satisfies the condition. Now, we will prove that $|S|_{\max} = 3$.

(1) At least one of $1$ and $-1$ must belong to $S$. Conversely, assume $a_1, a_2 \in S$ such that by the given condition, there exist $\alpha, b, c \in S$ satisfying $F(a_1) = F(a_2) = 0$. Then, $\frac{c}{a} = a_1a_2 \Rightarrow c = aa_1a_2$. Then, there exists $a_{3} = c \in S$, and repeating this process yields $\alpha_i \ (i=1,2,\cdots) \in S$, but $|\alpha_1| \leq |\alpha_2| < |\alpha_3| < \cdots < |\alpha_k| < \cdots$, which contradicts the fact that $S$ is a finite set.

(2) Without loss of generality, let $1 \in S$. There exists $a_1 \in S (\alpha \neq 1)$. Then, by the given condition, there exist $a, b, c \in S$ such that $a+b+c=0 \Rightarrow b = -a-c$, and $a_{1}+1=-\frac{b}{a}=1+\frac{c}{a}$. Thus, $a_1 = \frac{c}{a} \Rightarrow c = aa_1$. 

$(i)$ If $a_1 \geq 2$, then for $\alpha \neq \pm 1$, $|c| > |a_1|$. We can find $\alpha_2 = c \in S (|a_2| > |a_1|)$, leading to $|a_1| < |a_2| < \cdots \in S$, which contradicts the finiteness of $S$. If $a = 1, b = -a_1-1; a = -1, b = a_1+1$, then for any $\alpha = \pm 1$, $|b| > |\alpha_i|$, which also leads to a contradiction.

$(ii)$ If $a_1 \leq -2$, consider $-\frac{b}{a} = a_{1}+1, \frac{c}{a} = a_{1}$. By the assumption, there is no $a \in S$ such that $a \geq 2$. Since $a_1 \leq -2$, $b$ and $c$ have opposite signs. If $a \leq -2$, then $c > |a_1| \geq 2$, which is a contradiction. If $a = -1$, then $b = a_1+1, c = -a_1 \geq 2$, which also contradicts. If $\alpha = 1$, then $b = -a_1-1, c = a_1$. If $a_1 \leq -3$, then $b \geq 2$, which is a contradiction. Thus, we conclude that $a_1 \in \{-2,-1,0\}$.

It is evident that $S = \{-2,-1,0,1\}$ does not satisfy the condition. For example, for $-1, -2 \in S$, $x^2+3x+2=0$, which is impossible.

but $$\left(x^{2}+2\right)\left(y^{2}+3\right) \geqslant 2 \sqrt{2} x \cdot 2 \sqrt{3} y=4 \sqrt{6} x y>9 xy ,$$ contradiction.\\
If $z=4$, then
$\left(x^{2}+2\right)\left(y^{2}+3\right)=12xy$.

4862,"Below, a stronger conclusion is proven: For positive integers $n$, considering all non-increasing functions $f:\{1,2,\cdots,n\} \rightarrow \{1,2,\cdots,n\}$, among these functions, it's demonstrated that the difference in the number of functions with and without fixed points is $C_{2n-2}^{n-1}-C_{2n-2}^{n-2}=\frac{1}{n}C_{2n-2}^{n-1}$.
It's noted that there can be at most one fixed point in function $f$. First, using the method of inserting dividers, the number of non-increasing functions is $C_{n-1+n}^{n-1}=C_{2n-1}^{n-1}$. If a function $f$ has a fixed point, i.e., there exists $c$,
such that $f(c)=c$. When the fixed point is $c$, dividing it into two parts $[1,c-1]$ and $[c+1,n]$ and applying the method of inserting dividers again to calculate the number of non-increasing functions, the number of such functions $f$ with a fixed point is obtained as $C_{n-c+c-1-1}^{c-1}C_{c-1+n-c+1}^{n-c}=(C_{n-1}^{c-1})^2$. Consequently, the total number of functions $f$ with a fixed point is calculated as $\sum\limits_{c=1}^n(C_{n-1}^{c-1})^2=C_{2n-2}^{n-1}$.
As a result, the number of functions $f$ without a fixed point is found as $C_{2n-1}^{n-1}-C_{2n-2}^{n-1}=C_{2n-2}^{n-2}$. Therefore, the sought difference is calculated as $C_{2n-2}^{n-1}-C_{2n-2}^{n-2}=\frac{1}{n}C_{2n-2}^{n-1}$.

$\left(z+\frac{1}{k^{2}}+2\right)^{2}=4 k z^{2}+\frac{4 z}{k^{2}}+\frac{4 z}{k}-k^{2} z^{2}+4$

$\Rightarrow\left(4 k-k^{2}-1\right) z^{2}+\left(\frac{2}{k^{2}}+\frac{4}{k}-4\right) z-\left(\frac{1}{k^{4}}+\frac{4}{k^{2}}\right)=0$.\\
Notice that,

$\Delta=\left(\frac{2}{k^{2}}+\frac{4}{k}-4\right)^{2}+4\left(\frac{1}{k^{4}}+\frac{4}{k^{2}}\right)\left(4 k-k^{2}-1\right)$

$=\frac{32}{k^{3}}+\frac{32}{k}-\frac{20}{k^{2}}$.\\
If $k<0$, i.e. $y, z$ have different signs, then, $\Delta<0, z$ has no solution. Thus, the system of equations has no solution.\\
If $k>0$, when $y>0, z>0$, $\frac{x^{2}}{y}+z+\frac{z^{2}}{y^{2}}>0$, is contradiction with (1). Thus, $y<0, z<0$.\\
Solved from the original system of equations
$z^{3}-x^{2} y^{2}+x^{2} y=\frac{1}{4}\left(x^{4}+y^{4}\right)$\\
now, $z^{3}-x^{2} y^{2}+x^{2} y<0, \frac{1}{4}\left(x^{4}+y^{4}\right)>0$, contradiction. Therefore, there must be 0 among $x, y, z$.\\
(1) When $z=0$, the system of equations becomes
$x^{4}+y^{4}=0 \Rightarrow x=y=0$. Thus, $x=y=z=0$.\\
(2) When $y=0$, 
$\left\{\begin{array}{l}z^{2}=0 \\ z^{3}=\frac{1}{4} x^{4}\end{array}\right.$ $\Rightarrow x=y=z=0$. \\
(3) When $x=0$,
$\left\{\begin{array}{l}z\left(y^{2}+z\right)=0, \\ z^{3}+z y\left(z+y^{2}\right)=\frac{1}{4} y^{4}\end{array}\right.$ $\Rightarrow z^{3}=\frac{1}{4} y^{4}$. When $y, z$ are not equal to 0 at the same time, then $z>0$.
Therefore, $y^{2}+z=0$, contradiction.Thus, $y=z=0$.\\
Therefore, the only solution of the system of equations is $(x, y, z)=(0,0,0)$.",AI-Algebra26,"The system of equations $\left\{\begin{array}{l}x^{2} y+y^{2} z+z^{2}=0, \\ z^{3}+z^{2} y+z y^{3}+x^{2} y=\frac{1}{4}\left(x^{4}+y^{4}\right)\end{array}\right.$ has how many sets of real solution $(x,y,z)$ ?."
"\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}","Notice that, for any arrangement of $x, y, z$, only change the sign of the required formula, don't change the absolute value of it. Thus, only the maximum needs to be calculated. Set $x \geq y \geq z$. Then, from the mean inequality,

$\cdots$

$a_{(t-1)^{2}+1}=1, b_{(t-1)^{2}+1}=2 t ;$

$a_{(t-1)^{2}+2}=2, b_{(t-1)^{2}+2}=2 t ;$

$a_{t^{2}}=2 t-1, b_{t^{2}}=2 t$.\\
Then $\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{t}(2 j-1) 2 j=4 \sum_{j=1}^{t} j^{2}-2 \sum_{j=1}^{t} j=\frac{2 t(t+1)(2 t+1)}{3}-t(t+1)=\frac{t(t+1)(4 t-1)}{3}$.\\
So, $c \leq \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}}{n^{\frac{1}{2}}}=\frac{t(t+1)(4 t-1)}{3\left(t^{2}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}}=\frac{(t+1)(4 t-1)}{3 t^{2}} \rightarrow \frac{4}{3}(t \rightarrow+\infty)$.\\
Therefore, $c \leq \frac{4}{3}$.\\
The following is proved by mathematical induction: for each positive integer $n$ and all positive integers $a_{i}$ satisfying the conditions and all positive even numbers
 $b_{i}(i=1,2, \cdots, n)$, we all have $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}}{n^{\frac{3}{2}}} \geq \frac{4}{3}$.\\
When $n=1$, since $b_{1} \geq 2$, then $\frac{b_{1}}{1^{\frac{3}{2}}} \geq 2>\frac{4}{3}$.\\
Assume that equation (1) holds true, when $n=k$ ($k$ is positive integer). When $n=k+1$, consider positive integers $a_{i}$ and positive even numbers $b_{i}(i=1,2, \cdots, k+1)$ satisfying conditions. Next, we aim to prove that there exists $i_{0} \in\{1,2, \cdots, k+1\}$, such that $b_{i_{0}} \geq 2 \sqrt{k+1}$.\\
Assume that the conclusion is not true, then for each $i=1,2, \cdots, k+1$, we have $2 \leq b_{i}<2 \sqrt{k+1}$. Without loss of generality, suppose that the sequence $\left\{b_{i}\right\}(i=1,2, \cdots, k+1)$ is arranged in increasing order. Set $\sqrt{k+1}=m+a$, where,  $m=[\sqrt{k+1}]$ ( $[x]$ denotes the greatest integer not exceeding $x$), $0 \leq a<1$. Then $2 \leq b_{i}<2 \sqrt{k+1}=2 m+2 a<2 m+2 \Rightarrow 2 \leq b_{i} \leq 2 m+1$. Since $b_{i}$ is even number, thus, $2 \leq b_{i} \leq 2 m$.\\
For positive integer $j(1 \leq j \leq m)$, the number of positive integers $a_{i}$ satifying $b_{i}=2 j$ is at most $2 j-1$, i.e., $a_{i} \in\{1,2, \cdots, 2 j-1\}$. Therefore, $n=k+1 \leq \sum_{j=1}^{m}(2 j-1)=m^{2}$.\\
Thus, $m \geq \sqrt{k+1} \geq m$, which implies that all equalities hold, i.e., $m=\sqrt{k+1}$, $n=k+1=\sum_{j=1}^{m}(2 j-1)=m^{2}$, $b_{k+1}=2 \sqrt{k+1}$, contradiction.
Therefore, there exists $i_{0} \in\{1,2, \cdots, k+1\}$, such that $b_{i_{0}} \geq 2 \sqrt{k+1}$.\\
From the induction hypothesis, we can obtain

$\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} b_{i}=\sum_{\substack{i=1 \\ i \neq i_{0}}}^{k+1} b_{i}+b_{i_{0}}>\frac{4}{3} k^{\frac{3}{2}}+2 \sqrt{k+1}$.\\
To prove that equation (1) holds when n=k+1$ it suffices to show \frac{4}{3} k^{\frac{3}{2}}+2 \sqrt{k+1} \geq \frac{4}{3}(k+1)^{\frac{2}{2}}$. Notice that, equation (2)

$\Leftrightarrow \frac{4}{3} k \sqrt{k}+2 \sqrt{k+1} \geq \frac{4}{3}(k+1) \sqrt{k+1}$

$\Leftrightarrow 2 k \sqrt{k}+3 \sqrt{k+1} \geq 2(k+1) \sqrt{k+1}$

$\Leftrightarrow \sqrt{k+1} \geq 2 k(\sqrt{k+1}-\sqrt{k})$.\\
From $2 k(\sqrt{k+1}-\sqrt{k})=\frac{2 k}{\sqrt{k+1}+\sqrt{k}}<\frac{k}{\sqrt{k}}=\sqrt{k}<\sqrt{k+1}$.\\
Then equation (3) holds, thus equation (2) holds, thereby completing the proof of equation (1). From equation (1), we know that when $c=\frac{4}{3}$, the original inequality holds.\\

By contradiction:
Assume $M < 2n-1$, 
observe the numbers in the top row. Since the difference between any two adjacent numbers in this row is not greater than $2n-2$,
then when the rook piece moves from the smallest number in this row to the largest number, it cannot pass through the squares in the bottom row, because to reach the bottom row, it needs to take at least $n-1$ steps,  
and to return, it needs another $n-1 $ steps, and it still needs to spend one step for horizontal movement. This indicates that the rook piece does not pass through the squares in the bottom row when traversing all the numbers in the top row. Similarly, when the rook piece traverses all the numbers in the bottom row, it does not pass through the squares in the top row. This indicates that all the numbers in the top row are either all greater than or all less than all the numbers in the bottom row. Similarly, all the numbers in the leftmost column are either all greater than or all less than all the numbers in the rightmost column.

A,"Alice has a winning strategy.

Firstly, let $A$ and $B$ represent the products of the two cards in Alice's and Bob's hands respectively.

If $x-y$ or $x+y$ is revealed, then Alice chooses any two hidden cards. Otherwise, she picks one hidden card and one revealed card, ensuring she doesn't get both $x-y$ and $x+y$.

If Bob gets both $x-y$ and $x+y$, then Alice can choose $y=1$. In this case,

$A = (x^2-xy+y^2)(x^2+xy+y^2) = x^4+x^2+1$,

$B = (x-y)(x+y) = x^2-y^2 = x^2-1$,

thus $A-B = x^2+2 > 0$, and Alice wins.

If $B = (x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2) = x^3-y^3$,

32,"Firstly, we provide a counterexample for $k=31$.

Let $A=\{2,3,16,17,\ldots,31\}$ and $B=\{4,5,\ldots,15\}$.

If $k<31$, then simply remove integers greater than $k$ from sets $A$ and $B$ respectively.

Next, we prove that the conclusion holds when $k=32$.

Conversely, if the conclusion does not hold, then $2$ and $4$, and $4$ and $16$ are not in the same set respectively. Thus, $2$ and $16$ are in the same set. Similarly, $4$ and $8$ are in the same set. In this case, $32$ cannot be in any set $(32=2\times16=4\times8)$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $k$ is $32$.",Combinary-14,"Find the smallest integer $k > 2$ such that any partition of $\{2,3,\ldots,k\}$ into two sets must contain at least one set containing $a$, $b$, and $c$ (which are allowed to be the same), satisfying $ab=c$."
1010,"First, we prove that $k \geqslant 1010$.

Take 2019 points on the same line. Obviously, among these 2019 points on the line, at least 2018 of them need to be passed through by a circle.

Furthermore, since each circle can pass through the points on the line at most twice, if $k \leqslant 1009$, then the number of points passed through by these $k$ circles does not exceed 2018. Note that when equality holds, the first and last points are not contained within any circle, leading to a contradiction.

Next, we strengthen the proof that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $1010$-good drawing method.

The strengthened proposition is: ""Prove: there exists a $1010$-good drawing method such that these $1010$ circles pass through the same point.""

Perform an inversion transformation with a point on the plane not coinciding with any of the 2019 points and not lying on the circumcircle of any three points as the center of inversion. Then, after inversion, to prove the strengthened proposition, it suffices to prove that for any 2019 non-collinear points on the plane, there exist 1010 lines such that each pair of points has at least one line passing through them.

A line is said to ""bisect"" a set of points if the difference between the number of points on each side of the line is either 1 or equal.

Lemma:

For any two sets of points $A$ and $B$, there exists a line $l$ that bisects $A$ and $B$.

Proof: The portion of a plane divided by a line is called a half-plane. Obviously, there exists a half-plane containing half of the points in both $A$ and $B$, i.e., $2 \times$ the number of points in $A$ in the half-plane $-|A| \leqslant 1$.

It is evident that there exists a half-plane containing fewer than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a half-plane containing more than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a way to rotate and translate the half-plane so that it can be transformed from any half-plane containing half of the elements in $A$ to another, and the route of translation and rotation through half-planes. Therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, the proposition is proved.

A region including a given point is called a figure formed by closed lines, and the modulus of a region is the number of points in the region. Start by connecting a sufficiently large polygon enclosing all the points. Obviously, there is only one region at the beginning.

Consider drawing 1010 lines in order. Consider making each line bisect the two regions with the largest moduli at the moment, defining this as one operation. Next, we prove that this operation can be performed 1010 times.

The first operation generates a new region, and thereafter each operation generates two new regions. By induction, it is easy to see that the modulus of the region with the maximum modulus is no more than twice the modulus of the region with the minimum modulus, so if there is a region with a modulus of 1, then the moduli of the other regions must be either 1 or 2.

Therefore, when the last operation stops, there is at most one region with a modulus of 2 left. Due to parity considerations, there are 2018 regions at this point, and 1009 lines have been drawn. Drawing one more line to separate the two points left in the same region is enough. Thus, it is proved that it is possible to sequentially draw 1010 closed shapes such that no closed shape contains two points. Thus, the proposition is proved.",Combinary-15,"On a plane, there are 2019 points. Drawing circles passing through these points, a drawing method is called ""$k$-good"" if and only if drawing $k$ circles divides the plane into several closed shapes, and there is no closed shape containing two points.

2,"At least 2 people write down different numbers twice.

Let the $n$ people be denoted as $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{n}$.

Consider the following friendship relationship: $A_{i}$ is a friend of $A_{j}$ if and only if $|i-j|=1 (1 \leq i, j \leq n)$.

Under this friendship relationship, $A_{1}$ writes down the number $1$, $A_{i}$ writes down the number $i+1 (2 \leq i \leq n-1)$, and $A_{n}$ writes down the number $\frac{n+1}{2}$. Then after one pass,

the numbers written down by $A_{2}, A_{3}, \ldots, A_{n-1}$ remain unchanged. However, the number written down by $A_{1}$ changes from $1$ to $\frac{3}{2}$, and the number written down by $A_{n}$ changes from $\frac{n+1}{2}$ to $\frac{n}{2}$.

Hence, at this point, there are 2 people who write down different numbers twice.

Next, we prove that: at least 1 person writes down a smaller number the second time.

For each person, define their value as the ratio of the number they wrote down the first time to the number of their friends. Let the value of the person with the highest value among all be $M$.

Suppose person $B$ has a value of $M$, and $B$ has $k$ friends. Then the number written down by $B$ the first time is $kM$, and according to the rules of the game, the number written down by $B$ the second time is at most $kM$. If the number written down by $B$ the second time is smaller than $kM$, then the conclusion holds; if the number written down by $B$ the second time is $kM$, then the value of each of his friends is also $M$.

Construct a graph $G$, where the vertices are the $n$ people, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if the two people are friends. Consider the connected component $G'$ where $B$ is located.

From the above discussion, if the conclusion does not hold, then every person represented by a vertex in $G'$ has a value of $M$. Since the degree of each vertex in $G'$ is at least $1$ and at most $|V|-1$ (where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in $G'$), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two vertices with the same degree, which means the two people represented by these vertices wrote down the same number the first time, contradicting the condition. Thus, the conclusion holds.

Note that the sum of the numbers written down by all people the first time is equal to the sum of the numbers written down by all people the second time. From the conclusion, we know that at least one person writes down a smaller number the second time, thus, there must be another person who writes down a larger number the second time, so at least 2 people write down different numbers twice.",Combinary-18,"Given an integer $n > 2$.

The question is: what is the minimum number of times that someone writes down different numbers?"
5832,"Consider the general case, replacing 9 with $n$.

Consider unordered triples $(x, y, z)$, where $x, y, z$ belong to three different categories of dishes. There are $\binom{4}{3} \times n \times n \times n = 4n^3$ such triples.

Because no $n$ guests can simultaneously choose three identical dishes, for any triple $(x, y, z)$, it can belong to at most $n-1$ guests.

Moreover, each guest chooses one dish from each of the four categories, so each guest has 4 triples.

Let there be $x$ guests.

Then $4x \leq 4n^3(n-1) \Rightarrow x \leq n^3(n-1)$.

Next, we prove that when there are $n^3(n-1)$ guests, the conditions of the problem can be satisfied.

We consider four categories of dishes as four sets $A, B, C, D$, and each set contains $n$ dishes labeled as $1, 2, \ldots, n$.

We will remove the following selections: the sum of the four numbers chosen is exactly divisible by $n$. There are $n^3$ such selections to remove. The remaining number of selections is $n^4 - n^3$, which corresponds to $n^4 - n^3$ guests, each with one selection.

According to the selection rules, we know that no two people choose the same four dishes. (1)

If a particular triple appears more than $n-1$ times, select $n$ guests containing this triple. According to conclusion (1), there exists a category of dishes such that the $n$ dishes chosen by these guests from this category are all different.

Because each category of dishes has only $n$ dishes, these $n$ guests cover all dishes in this category.

Since $1, 2, \ldots, n$ form a complete residue system modulo $n$, there must be an integer $i (1 \leq i \leq n)$ such that $n \equiv x + y + z + i \pmod{n}$.

However, such selections have been removed, which is a contradiction.

Therefore, the selections of these $n^4 - n^3$ dishes satisfy the conditions of the problem.

It is known that any two people's choices of the four dishes are not completely identical, and it is also impossible to find four people on the spot who have three identical choices but differ pairwise in the fourth choice (for example, there are no 9 people who have the same appetizer, main course, and dessert, but differ pairwise in the wine).

A,"It suffices to prove that even under optimal conditions for each step, Alice still cannot guarantee victory.

Note that if we draw the perpendicular bisector of $P_k P_{k-1}$ for each $k (1 \leq k \leq n)$, Alice can determine on which side of the perpendicular bisector point $B$ lies. Consequently, starting from the selection of $P_1$, after each point is chosen, Alice can narrow down the range where point $B$ is guaranteed to be by at most $\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, after selecting $n$ points, Alice can ensure that point $B$ lies within an area of no less than $\frac{1}{2^n}$.

If Alice can guarantee victory, she should be able to cover an area of no less than $\frac{1}{2^n}$ with a disk of radius $\frac{1}{2020}$.

B,"Carl has a winning strategy.

Carl's winning strategy is to choose the number $p - a$ whenever Anna selects the number $a$ in a round.

Next, we prove that Carl's strategy guarantees his victory.

Conversely, if Carl's selection strategy does not lead to victory, specifically, if he still has not won after all numbers are chosen, then it implies that $p$ does not divide $1(p-1)+2(p-2)+\cdots+\frac{p-1}{2}\left(p-\frac{p-1}{2}\right)$.

Let $S$ denote:
\[S = 1(p-1)+2(p-2)+\cdots+\frac{p-1}{2}\left(p-\frac{p-1}{2}\right)\]
\[= p\left(1+2+\cdots+\frac{p-1}{2}\right)-\left(1^{2}+2^{2}+\cdots+\left(\frac{p-1}{2}\right)^{2}\right)\]
\[= p\left(1+2+\cdots+\frac{p-1}{2}\right)-\frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{p-1}{2} \cdot \frac{p+1}{2} p\]

Thus, $p$ does not divide $S$ if and only if $24 \mid (p^{2}-1) \cdot (2)$.

Since $p$ is an odd prime number,
\[8 \mid (p^{2}-1) \Rightarrow 8 \mid (p-1)(p+1)\]

Combining equations (1) and (2), we have
\[3 \nmid (p^{2}-1) \Rightarrow 3 \nmid (p-1)(p+1)\]

Thus, $3 \mid p$, which means $p=3$, contradicting the conditions.

Since $C$ and $D$ are complementary, it follows that $A_{i} \subset D$ and $A_{j} \subset C$. Thus, $A_{i} \cap A_{j}=\varnothing$, which is a contradiction.

Therefore, $k=2^{9}$ or 512.",Combinary-24,"The school offers 10 elective courses, and each student can enroll in any number of courses.

Then $k=$ \_\_\_\_\_."
2024,"For a positive integer $n$, we prove that the minimum value of $T$ is $n$.

First, we provide an estimation.

Initially, we notice that the frog's jump length must be one of the terms in the set $\left\{2^{0}, 2^{1}, \cdots, 2^{n-1}\right\}$; otherwise, it would jump out of bounds.

Let $a_{i}$ ($0 \leq i \leq n-1$) denote the number of times the frog jumps $2^{i}$ steps. According to the conditions, we have $a_{0}+a_{1}+\cdots+a_{n-1}=2^{n}-1$.

Lemma: For any $k=1,2, \cdots, n$, we have $a_{n-1}+\cdots+a_{n-k} \leq 2^{n}-2^{n-k}$.

To prove this, let $m=n-k$ and consider the jump lengths modulo $2^{m}$. We categorize jumps less than $2^{m-1}$ as ""small jumps"" and those greater than or equal to $2^{m}$ as ""big jumps"". It is notable that small jumps change the residue class modulo $2^{m}$, while big jumps do not.

For each residue class modulo $2^{m}$, the frog can make at most $\frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1$ big jumps. Therefore, the number of big jumps is at most $2^{m}\left(\frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1\right)=2^{n}-2^{m}$.

The lemma is proved.

For example, when $n=3$: for $k=1$, $a_{2} \leq 2^{3}-2^{2}$ implies that there can be at most four jumps of length 4; for $k=2$, $a_{2}+a_{1} \leq 2^{3}-2^{1}$ implies that there can be at most six jumps of length 2 or 4; for $k=3$, $a_{2}+a_{1}+a_{0} \leq 2^{3}-2^{0}$ implies a total of at most 7 jumps. To achieve the maximum $S$, it is observed that when $a_{2}=4, a_{1}=2, a_{0}=1$, the maximum is attained. Therefore, it is speculated that the maximum value is attained when $a_{m}=2^{m}$.

Let $A=a_{0}+a_{1}+\cdots+a_{n-1}=2^{n}-1$, and $T=a_{0}+\frac{a_{1}}{2}+\cdots+\frac{a_{n-1}}{2^{n-1}}$. Then, according to the lemma, we have:

$A-T \leq 2^{n}-n-1$

$\Rightarrow T \geq n$

Equality holds when $a^{m}=2^{m}$.

Next, we use induction to construct two types of paths such that the frog jumps to $\left\{0,1, \cdots, 2^{n}-1\right\}$ exactly once, stopping at $x$ where $x \in\{1,2 n-1\}$.

When $n=2$, there are two paths: $\{0,2,1,3\}$ and $\{0,2,3,1\}$.

Assume the claim holds for $n$, we prove it for $n+1$.

(i) By the induction hypothesis, there is a path from 0 to 2: $\left\{0,2,4, \cdots, 2^{n+1}-2\right\}$.
(ii) Similarly, there is a path from 1 to $2^{n+1}-1$: $\left\{1,3,5, \cdots, 2^{n+1}-1\right\}$.
(iii) Connecting these two paths requires one step from 2 to 1.

Therefore, we can use the path $0 \rightarrow\left(2^{n+1}-2\right) \rightarrow\left(2^{n+1}-1\right) \rightarrow 1$.

Hence, the minimum value of $T$ is $n$.

In this question, when $n=2024$, the answer is 2024.",Combinary-25,"Let $n$ be a positive integer. Now, a frog starts jumping from the origin of the number line and makes $2^{n}-1$ jumps. The process satisfies the following conditions:

2^{22},"The problem examines the maximum number of different perfect matches for a bipartite graph with two sets of the same number of vertices under the condition of a specified number of edges, and clarifies the basic structure of the graph when obtaining the maximum value.

The problem structure is described using a graph.

Let \(V=\{v_{1}, v_{2}, \cdots, v_{66}\}\) be the set of 66 dwarves, and \(U=\{u_{1}, u_{2}, \cdots, u_{66}\}\) be the set of 66 colors.

If dwarf \(v_{i}\) has a hat of color \(u_{j}\), then draw an edge between \(v_{i}\) and \(u_{j}\), and let \(E\) be the set of all such edges, obtaining the graph \(G(V, U ; E)\). Each way of wearing hats that satisfies the requirements for every holiday is a perfect match of \(G\). The problem is to find the maximum number \(f(G)\) of different perfect matches for graph \(G\).

The lemma states that for a bipartite graph \(G\left(V_{1}, V_{2} ; E\right)\) with \(\left|V_{1}\right|=\left|V_{2}\right|\), it holds that \(f(G) \leq 2^{\left[\frac{|E|-\left|E_{1}\right|}{2}\right]}\), where \([x]\) represents the largest integer not exceeding the real number \(x\).

Proof is by mathematical induction.

It is easy to prove that when \(\left|V_{1}\right|=\left|V_{2}\right|=1\), the conclusions hold true.

Suppose the conclusions hold when \(\left|V_{1}\right|=\left|V_{2}\right|=n-1(n \geq 2)\). Consider the case when \(\left|V_{1}\right|=\left|V_{2}\right|=n\).

Consider the bipartite graph \(G\left(V_{1}, V_{2} ; E\right)\).

If \(G\) has isolated vertices, then \(f(G)=0\), and the conclusions hold true. Otherwise, let \(a \in V_{1}\) be the vertex in \(G\) with the smallest degree \(N(N \geq 1)\), and let \(b_{1}, b_{2}, \cdots, b_{N}\) be the neighbors of \(a\). Let \(G_{i}=\left(U_{i}, U_{i}^{\prime} ; E_{i}\right)\) denote the bipartite graph obtained by deleting vertex \(a\) and vertices \(b_{i}\), as well as the edges incident to \(a\) or \(b_{i}\).

Then \(\left|U_{i}\right|=\left|U_{i}^{\prime}\right|=n-1\), and \(\left|E_{i}\right| \leq|E|-(2 N-1)\).

By the induction hypothesis, it follows that \(f\left(G_{i}\right) \leq 2^{\left[\frac{\left|E_{i}\right|-\left|U_{i}\right|}{2}\right]} \leq 2^{\left[\frac{|E|-(2 N-1)-(n-1)}{2}\right]}=2^{\left[\frac{|E|-n}{2}\right]} \frac{1}{2^{N-1}}\).

Therefore, \(f(G)=f\left(G_{1}\right)+f\left(G_{2}\right)+\cdots+f\left(G_{N}\right) \leq \frac{N}{2^{N-1}} 2^{\left[\frac{|E|-n}{2}\right]}\).

By Bernoulli's inequality, \(2^{N-1} \geq 1+(N-1)=N\). Thus, \(f(G) \leq \frac{N}{2^{N}} 2^{\left[\frac{|E|-n}{2}\right]} \leq 2^{\left[\frac{|E|-n}{2}\right]}\).

The lemma is proved.

In particular, when \(n=66,|E| \leq 111\),

\(f(G) \leq 2^{\left[\frac{111-66}{2}\right]}=2^{22}\).

On the other hand, let graph \(G\) be composed of 22 complete bipartite graphs \(K_{2,2}\) and one bipartite graph \(K_{1,1}\). In this case, \(|E|=110\), and each complete bipartite graph \(K_{2,2}\) has 2 perfect matches, so \(f(G)=2^{22}\).

Therefore, the maximum number of different perfect matches is \(2^{22}\).",Combinary-26,"Given that there are 66 dwarves with a total of 111 hats, each hat belonging to a specific dwarf, and each hat is dyed in one of 66 colors. During the holiday, each dwarf wears his own hat. It is known that for any holiday, the colors of the hats worn by all dwarves are different. For any two holidays, there is at least one dwarf who wears hats of different colors on the two occasions. The question is: how many holidays can the dwarves celebrate at most?"
2023,"Consider the residue classes modulo 17, where the residue class with residue $i$ is represented as $17k+i$ ($k$ is a natural number $1 \leqslant i \leqslant 17 $).

If $n<2023$ , then
$11 y-118x \leqslant x-2023<0 \Rightarrow 119y<118x$,
and $118 x \leqslant 119 y$, contradiction.
Therefore, when $n<2023$, the condition is not satisfied.

When $n=2023$, since $2023=17 \times 119 $, it is known that $118 \times 17+i(i=0,1, \cdots, 17)$ are 18 numbers not exceeding $n$. By the Pigeonhole Principle, among these 18 numbers $\times 17+i(i=0,1, \cdots, 17)$ , there must be two numbers x and $(x>y)$ in the possession of the same person.

Let $x=118 \times 17+x_{1}$ and $y=118 \times 17+y_{1}$, where $ 17 \geqslant
x_{1} \geqslant y_{1} \geqslant 0$ .
then

 
\[
\begin{array}{l}
118x-119y\\
=118\left(118 \times 17+x_{1}\right)-119\left(118 \times 17+y_{1}\right) \\
=\left(118 x_{1}-119 y_{1}\right)-118 \times 17 \\
\leqslant 118 x_{1}-118 \times 17 \\
\leqslant 118 \times 17-118 \times 17=0 .

According to this equation, where the same letter represents the same digit, and different letters represent different digits, let's analyze the possibilities:

First, we consider the case where \(c=3\):

Since \(20^{3} \times 200=1600000\), exceeding six digits, we conclude that \(a=1\). Thus, the equation becomes:

$$
\left[(\overline{1 b})^{3}-1\right] \times \overline{13 d}=\overline{1 b 3} \times 1000
$$

However, since there are 3 factors of 5 on the right side of the equation, and \(\overline{13 d}\) can only provide at most 1 factor of 5, we infer that \((\overline{1 b})^{3}-1\) must be a multiple of 25. This implies that the last two digits of \((\overline{1})^{3}\) can be \(01, 26, 51,\) or \(76\). By considering the units place, we find that \(b=1\) or \(6\), but neither of these options satisfies the conditions.

Next, let's explore the case where \(c=2\). This yields:

$$
\left[(\overline{a b})^{2}-1\right] \times \overline{a 2 d}=\overline{a b 2000}
$$

From this equation, we deduce that:

$$(\overline{a b})^{2}-1=1000 \times \frac{\overline{a b 2}}{\overline{a 2 d}}$$

Because \(0.5<\frac{\overline{a b 2}}{\overline{a 2 d}}<2\), we conclude that \(500<(\overline{a b})^{2}-1<2000\). Hence, \(a\) can be \(2, 3,\) or \(4\). However, since \(\overline{a 2 d}\) cannot be 125 or 625, it can provide at most 2 factors of 5. Therefore, \((\overline{a b})^{2}-1\) must be a multiple of 5, leading to the possible values \(b=1, 9, 4,\) or \(6\).

Based on the equation \(\left[(\overline{a b})^{2}-1\right] \times \overline{a 2 d}=\overline{a b 2000}\), we have:

(1) \((\overline{a b}+1) \times \overline{a 2 d}=\overline{a b 2000} \div(\overline{a b}-1)>1000\)

(2) \((\overline{a b}-1) \times \overline{a 2 d}=\overline{a b 2000} \div(\overline{a b}+1)<1000\)

Consequently, \(a\) can only be 3. Then, \((\overline{a b}-1) \times(\overline{a b}+1)\) cannot be a multiple of 25, implying that \(\overline{a 2 d}\) must be a multiple of 25. Thus, \(d=5\), and \(\overline{a 2 d}=325\).

Now, \((\overline{3 b}-1) \times(\overline{3 b}+1) \times 325=\overline{3 b 2000}\), where \(\overline{3 b 2000}\) is a multiple of 16. This means that either \((\overline{3 b}-1)\) or \((\overline{3 b}+1)\) must be a multiple of 8. Therefore, \(b\) can be 1 or 3. Since \(a=3\), \(b\) can only be 1.

After verifying: \(31^{2} \times 325=312325\), so \(\overline{a b c d}=3125\).",Combinary-37,"In the equation, the same letter represents the same digit, and different letters represent different digits. Then, the four-digit number \(\overline{a b c d}\) is given by:

$$
(\overline{a b})^{c} \times \overline{a c d}=\overline{a b c a c d}
$$"
116,"For a nonzero natural number $a$, if it can be expressed as the difference of squares of two nonzero natural numbers, let $a=m^{2}-n^{2}$ (here $m$ and $n$ are both nonzero natural numbers, and $m>n$). Since $m^{2}-n^{2}=(m-n)(m+n)$, both $m-n$ and $m+n$ are factors of the natural number $a$. Considering that the parity of $m-n$ and $m+n$ is the same, thus for any pair of positive integers $p$ and $q$ with the same parity $(p>q)$, their product $pq$ can always be expressed as the difference of squares of two nonzero natural numbers, $\left(\frac{p+q}{?}\right)^{2}-\left(\frac{p-q}{?}\right)^{2}$ is the corresponding representation. This indicates that as long as we can find out how many pairs of positive integers $(p, q)$ with the same parity exist such that $p>q$ and $1 \leq pq \leq 100$, the number of such pairs exactly equals the value of $F(1)+F(2)+F(3)+\cdots+F(100)$.

When $q=1$, $p$ can take 3, 5, 7, $3, 99$, there are 49 pairs $(p, q)$ satisfying the condition;

When $q=2$, $p$ can take $4, 6, 8, \ldots, 50$, there are 24 pairs $(p, q)$ satisfying the condition;

When $q=3$, $p$ can take 5, 7, 9, ...33, there are 15 pairs $(p, q)$ satisfying the condition;

When $q=4$, $p$ can take $6, 8, 10, \ldots, 24$, there are 10 pairs $(p, q)$ satisfying the condition;

When $q=5$, $p$ can take $7, 9, 11, \ldots, 19$, there are 7 pairs $(p, q)$ satisfying the condition;

When $q=6$, $p$ can take $8, 10, 12, 14, 16$, there are 5 pairs $(p, q)$ satisfying the condition;

When $q=7$, $p$ can take $9, 11, 13$, there are 3 pairs $(p, q)$ satisfying the condition;

When $q=8$, $p$ can take $10, 12$, there are 2 pairs $(p, q)$ satisfying the condition;

When $q=9$, $p$ can only take 11, there is only 1 pair $(p, q)$ satisfying the condition;

For the second integral, by a change of variables $x=4\sin\theta$ we get
\begin{align*}
\int_0^4 \sqrt{16 - x^2} \,dx&=\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\sqrt{16 - 16\sin^2\theta}\ 4\cos\theta \,d\theta\\
&=\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\sqrt{16 \cos^2\theta}\ 4\cos\theta \,d\theta\\
&=\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}16\cos^2\theta \,d\theta\\
&=\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}16\frac{1+\cos(2\theta)}{2}\,d\theta\\
&=8 \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} (1 + \cos (2\theta)) \,d\theta \\
 & = 8 \left.\left[\theta + \frac{1}{2}\sin (2\theta)\right]\right|_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \\
 & = 8 \left[\left(\frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\sin \pi\right) - (0 + 0)\right] \\
 & = 4 \pi .
\end{align*}

So, $\displaystyle{ \int_0^4 (2x - \sqrt{16 - x^2}) \,dx = 16 - 4\pi }$.\\",,Evaluate $\displaystyle{\int_0^4(2x-\sqrt{16-x^2})dx}$.
0.42,"First, express the general term $\frac{1}{(n+1)(n+3)}$ in partial fraction form:
\[
\frac{1}{(n+1)(n+3)} = \frac{A}{n+1} + \frac{B}{n+3}. 
\]
Multiplying both sides by the common denominator $(n+1)(n+3)$ we obtain
$$1 = A(n+3) + B(n+1) \Leftrightarrow 1 = (A+B)n + (3A+B). $$
Thus, 
\begin{align*}
\begin{cases}
A + B &= 0, \\
3A + B &= 1. 
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
Solving this system of equations, we find that $A = \frac{1}{2}$ and $B = -\frac{1}{2}$.

Now, we have
\[
\frac{1}{(n+1)(n+3)} = \frac{1/2}{n+1} -\frac{1/2}{n+3}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{n+1}-\frac{1}{n+3}\right)
\]
Now, using the telescoping nature of the series:
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(n+1)(n+3)} &= \frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=1}^\infty\left( \frac{1}{n+1}-\frac{1}{n+3}\right)\\

&=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}\right]=\frac{5}{12}.
\end{align*}\\",,Evaluate the series $\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{(n+1)(n+3)}$.
-\frac{ e}{2},"We can use L'H\^{o}pital's Rule to obtain
\[
\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{\ln(1+x)}{x}=\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{\frac{1}{1+x}}{1}=1.
\]
Then,
\[
\lim\limits_{x\to 0}(1+x)^{\frac{1}{x}}=\lim\limits_{x\to 0}e^{\ln{(1+x)^{\frac{1}{x}}}}=\lim\limits_{x\to 0}e^{\frac{\ln(1+x)}{x}}=e^1=e.
\]

Let $f(x) (1+x)^{\frac{1}{x}}$, then $\lim\limits_{x\to 0}f(x)=e$ and the given limit can be written as:
\[ 
\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{(1+x)^{\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x} = \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{f(x) - e}{x}. 
\]
Now, find the derivative of \(f(x)\) by using the chain rule and the quotient rule:
\begin{align*}
 f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(1+x)^{\frac{1}{x}}= \frac{d}{dx}e^{\ln{(1+x)^{\frac{1}{x}}}}&=\frac{d}{dx}e^{\frac{\ln(1+x)}{x}}\\
 &=e^{\frac{\ln(1+x)}{x}} \frac{d}{dx}\frac{\ln(1+x)}{x}\\
 &=(1+x)^{\frac{1}{x}}\cdot\frac{\frac{x}{1+x}-\ln(1+x)}{x^2}.
 \end{align*}
Using L'H\^{o}pital's Rule again to get
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{f(x) - e}{x}=\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{f'(x)}{1}&=\lim\limits_{x\to 0}(1+x)^{\frac{1}{x}}\cdot \lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{\frac{x}{1+x}-\ln(1+x)}{x^2}\\
&=e \cdot \lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{\frac{(1+x)-x}{(1+x)^2}-\frac{1}{1+x}}{2x}\\
&=e \cdot \lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{-1}{2(1+x)^2}\\
&=-\frac{e}{2}.
\end{align*}

Therefore,
\[ 
\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{(1+x)^{\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x} =-\frac{e}{2}.

\ln\sqrt{3},"For $x\in (-1,1)$, we have
\[
\frac{1}{1-x^2}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty x^{2n}.
\]
The series on the right-hand side converges uniformly on any interval $[-x, x]$ for any $x\in (0, 1)$.
Taking the integrals on both sides yields
\[
\int_0^x\frac{1}{1-t^2}dt=\int_0^x\sum_{n=0}^\infty t^{2n}dt=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\int_0^x t^{2n}dt=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{2n+1}x^{2n+1}.
\]
Noting that by partial fraction of $\frac{1}{1-t^2}=\frac12\left(\frac{1}{1+t}+\frac{1}{1-t}\right)$, we have, for $x\in (0,1)$,
\[
\int_0^x\frac{1}{1-t^2}dt=\frac{1}{2}\int_0^x\left(\frac{1}{1+t}+\frac{1}{1-t}\right)dt=\frac12\ln\left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right).
\]
So, 
\[
\frac12\ln\left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{2n+1}x^{2n+1}.
\]
Taking $x=\frac12$ leads to 
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{2n+1}\left(\frac12\right)^{2n+1}=\frac12\ln 3=\ln\sqrt{3}.
\]\\",,Evaluate the series $\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{2n+1}\left(\frac12\right)^{2n+1}$.
\frac{\pi}{2},"To evaluate this limit, we can interpret this sum as a Riemann sum and convert it into an integral.

Let $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}$ on the interval $[0, 1)$. Notice that $f(x)$ is integrable on the interval $[0,1)$. 

The given sum can be expressed as:
\[ 
\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{n^2 - k^2}} =\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{n}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{k}{n}\right)^2}}= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} f\left(\frac{k}{n}\right).
 \]
By the definition of definite integral, we have
\[ 
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} f\left(\frac{k}{n}\right) = \int_{0}^{1} f(x) \,dx=\int_0^1\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}\,dx .
\]

By a substitution of $x = \sin(\theta)$, we have
\begin{align*}
\int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \,dx &= \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \sin^2(\theta)}} \cos(\theta) \,d\theta \\
&= \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)} \cos(\theta) \,d\theta\\
& = \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} d\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}
\end{align*}
Therefore, we obtain $\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{n^2 - k^2}}=\frac{\pi}{2}$.\\


An alternative method to evaluate $\displaystyle{\int_0^1\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}\,dx}$:
\[
\int_0^1\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}\,dx=\arcsin{x}\big|_0^1=\arcsin(1)-\arcsin(0)=\frac{\pi}{2}-0=\frac{\pi}{2}.
\] \\",,Evaluate the limit $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\sum\limits_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{1}{\sqrt{n^2-k^2}}$.
\alpha=1 and \beta=4.,"Noting that $\lim\limits_{x\to 0} \displaystyle{\int_0^x\frac{2t}{\sqrt{\beta+t^2}}dt}=0$, if the given limit exists and equals $1$, we must have 
\[\lim\limits_{x\to 0}(\alpha-\cos x)=0.
\]
 Then, we get $\alpha=1$.

Using L'H\^{o}pital's rule and the fundamental theorem of calculus, we have
\begin{align*}
& \lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{1-\cos{ x}}\ \int_0^x\frac{2t}{\sqrt{\beta+t^2}}dt=\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{\frac{d}{dx}\left(\int_0^x\frac{2t}{\sqrt{\beta+t^2}}dt\right)}{\frac{d}{dx}(1-\cos{ x})}\\
=& \lim\limits_{x\to 0}\, \frac{\frac{2x}{\sqrt{\beta+x^2}}}{\sin{x}}= 2\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{x}{\sin{x}}\,\cdot\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{\sqrt{\beta+x^2}}=2(1)\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\beta}}\right)=\frac{2}{\sqrt{\beta}}.
\end{align*}
Since this limit equals $1$, we must have $\beta=4$.

Therefore, we obtain $\alpha=1$ and $\beta=4$.\\",,"Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be positive constant. If $\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\displaystyle{\frac{1}{\alpha-\cos{ x}}\ \int_0^x\frac{2t}{\sqrt{\beta+t^2}}\,dt=1}$, determine the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$."
8,"We'll use the arc length formula for polar curves:
\[
 L = \int_0^{2\pi} \sqrt{r^2 + \left(\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right)^2} \,d\theta.
  \]
For the cardioid $r = 1 + \cos{\theta}$, we have $\frac{dr}{d\theta} = -\sin{\theta}$.
Now, substitute $r$ and $\frac{dr}{d\theta}$ into the arc length formula and use a change of variables:
\begin{align*}
 L &= \int_0^{2\pi} \sqrt{(1 + \cos{\theta})^2 + (-\sin{\theta})^2} \,d\theta \\
 &= \int_0^{2\pi}\sqrt{1 + 2\cos{\theta} + \cos^2{\theta} + \sin^2{\theta}} \,d\theta\\
 &=\int_0^{2\pi}\sqrt{2 + 2\cos{\theta}} \,d\theta =\int_0^{2\pi}2\left|\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right| \,d\theta\\
  &=\int_0^{\pi}4\left|\cos\left(\alpha\right)\right| \,d\alpha =8\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\cos\left(\alpha\right) \,d\alpha =8\sin \alpha\big|_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}=8.

\[ 
A = \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} \frac{1}{2}\left((2+2\cos{\theta})^2 - 2^2\right) \,d\theta. 
\]

The bounds $\alpha$ and $\beta$ correspond to the angles at which the two curves intersect. To find these intersection points, set
\[
2=2+\cos{\theta}.

Then, $\cos\theta=0$. For the given two curves, we can take $\theta = -\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\theta =\frac{\pi}{2}$.

Then, we have $\alpha =- \frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\beta = \frac{\pi}{2}$. Thus,

2e,"First, we solve the differential equation to get $y(x) = 2e^{\frac{1}{2}x^2}$. 
\begin{align*}
  \frac{dy}{dx} & = xy \Leftrightarrow      \frac{1}{y} dy = x dx \Leftrightarrow  
    \int \frac{1}{y} dy = \int x dx  \\ \Rightarrow
    \ln|y| &= \frac{1}{2}x^2 + C \Rightarrow \,
    y = \pm e^{\frac{1}{2}x^2 + C}.
\end{align*}
With $y(0) = 2$, we have that $C = \ln 2$ and the solution is $y = 2e^{\frac{1}{2}x^2}$.

Next, we evaluate the function to get $y(\sqrt{2}) =2e $.",,Consider the differential equation $\frac{dy}{dx} = xy$. Find the value of $y(\sqrt{2})$ given that $y(0) = 2$.
y = e^{-x}.,"To solve it, we use an integrating factor, \(\mu(x) = e^{\int 2dx} = e^{2x}\). Multiplying the entire equation by \(\mu(x)\) gives:
\begin{align*}
    e^{2x} \frac{dy}{dx} + 2e^{2x}y =     \frac{d}{dx}(e^{2x}y)  &= e^{2x}e^{-x} = e^{x}. 
\end{align*}
Hence, $e^{2x}y = \int e^{x} dx = e^{x} + C$, which implies $y = e^{-x} + Ce^{-2x}$. 

Using the initial condition \(y(0) = 1\), we obtain     $1= y(0)= 1 = e^{0} + Ce^{-0} = 1+C$, so $C=0$. Therefore, the solution is $y = e^{-x}$.",,"Solve the following first-order differential equation:

This quadratic equation cannot hold for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$ unless $C_1=C_2=C_3=0$, that is, $y_1,y_2,y_3$ are linearly independent.

Even if the nonlinearity is locally linear ($o(\sqrt{x^2+y^2})$ size near $(0,0)$), we cannot tell the type of the equilibrium $(x,y)=(0,0)$ for the nonlinear system.

That is to say, $V(x,y)$ is increasing as $t$ grows. So, any trajectory starting near the origin will penetrate the circles (the trajectories for the linearized system) and leave away from the equilibrium $(x,y)=(0,0)$. Thus, the equilibrium $(x,y)=(0,0)$ for the nonlinear system is unstable.",,"For the ODE system $x'(t)=y+x(x^2+y^2)$ and $y'(t)=-x+y(x^2+y^2)$, is the equilibrium $(x,y)=(0,0)$ stable?"

To determine the solution in $\{0<x<2t\}$, we need the boundary data $u(t,0)=g(t):=A+Bt$. Let $x=0$ in the general solution, we get $g(t)=F(-t/2)$ for any $t>0$.

\frac{f(x_1,\ldots, x_n|\theta_2)}{f(x_1,\ldots, x_n|\theta_1)} = \frac{\frac{2^2}{\theta_2^n}\left(\prod_{i=1}^n x_i\right) e^{-\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2/\theta_2}}{\frac{2^2}{\theta_1^n}\left(\prod_{i=1}^n x_i\right) e^{-\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2/\theta_1}} = \left(\frac{\theta_1}{\theta_2}\right)^ne^{-\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2(\frac{1}{\theta_2}-\frac{1}{\theta_1})},
\]
which is increasing in $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2$. By the Karlin-Rubin theorem, the size-$\alpha$ UMP test reject $H_0$ if $\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2>c$ where $c$ is some constant such that $P_{\theta_0}(\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2>c)=\alpha$. 

Note that $X_i^2$ has the exponential distribution ${\rm Exp}(\theta)$, implying $\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2$ has the gamma distribution ${\rm Gamma}(n,\theta)$. Thus,
$2\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2/\theta$ has the gamma distribution ${\rm Gamma}(n,2)$ which is the same as $\chi_{2n}^2$, the chi-squared distribution with degree of freedom $2n$. Therefore, we have
\[
\alpha=P_{\theta_0}(\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2>c)=P(\chi_{2n}^2>2c/\theta_0),
\]
implying that $2c/\theta_0=\chi_{2n, \alpha}^2$ and hence $c=\frac{\theta_0}{2} \chi_{2n, \alpha}^2$.",,"Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be i.i.d. sample from the population density
	\[
	f(x|\theta) = \frac{2}{\theta}xe^{-x^2/\theta} I(x>0), \quad \theta>0.
	\] 
Consider using appropriate chi-square distribution to find the size $\alpha$ uniformly most powerful (UMP) test for $H_0: \theta\le \theta_0$ vs. $H_1: \theta> \theta_0$. Let $\chi_{2n, \alpha}^2$ is the value such that $P(\chi_{2n}^2 > \chi_{2n, \alpha}^2) = \alpha$ and $\chi_{2n}^2$ is the chi-squared distribution with degree of freedom $2n$. Should the UMP test reject $H_0$ if $\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 > \frac{\theta_0}{2} \chi_{2n, \alpha}^2$?"
